### GStreamer Ingestor

**NOTE**:

- The Gstreamer elements used are being leveraged from OpenVINO DL Streamer Framework.
  For debugging purpose one can use the `gst-inspect-1.0` and `gst-launch-1.0` tool with
  the gstreamer elements. In order to use the tool with the VideoIngestion container refer
  the below steps.

  ```sh

  # 1. Use `docker exec` to run a command in a running container

  $ docker exec -it ia_video_ingestion bash

  # 2. Source the OpenVINO setupvars.sh script inside the VideoIngestion container

  $ source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh

  **Note**: For VAAPI elements few additional env variables need to be exported. Refer VideoIngestion/vi_start.sh for exporting those additional variables.

  # 3. Run the gstreamer command using the tool.

  # For e.g inorder to print info about a gstreamer element like `gvadetect` use the gst-inspect.1.0 tool

  $ gst-inspect-1.0 gvadetect

  # To view information about Generic Plugin or exercise it then update the GST_PLUGIN_PATH to include below path and then use the `gst-inspect-1.0` tool

  $ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=$GST_PLUGIN_PATH:"/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0"

  $ gst-inspect-1.0 gencamsrc

  ```

- If running on non-gfx systems or older systems which doesn't have hardware
  media decoders (like in Xeon m/c) it is recommended to use `opencv` ingestor

- `gstreamer` ingestor expects the image format to be in `BGR` format so the output image format should be in `BGR`

- `poll_interval` key is not applicable for `gstreamer` ingestor. Refer the usage of `videorate` element in the below section to control the framerate in case of `gstreamer` ingestor.
- In case one wants to reduce the ingestion rate with `gstreamer` ingestor the `videorate` element can be used to control the framerate in the gstreamer pipeline.

  **Example pipeline to use the `videorate` element**:

  ```javascript
  {
  "type": "gstreamer",
  "pipeline": "multifilesrc loop=TRUE stop-index=0 location=./test_videos/pcb_d2000.avi ! h264parse ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! videorate ! video/x-raw,framerate=5/1 ! appsink"
  }
  ```

  >**Note**: In the above example after the stream is decoded and the color space conversion is done the framerate is adjusted to 5 FPS (The incoming stream framerate is 20 which is adjusted to 5 FPS). The correction in framerate is performed by dropping the frames in case the framerate is adjusted to a lower ethan the input stream. In case the framerate is adjusted to a higher FPS compared to the input stream then frames will be duplicated.

  For more information on `videorate` element refer the below link:
  <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/videorate/index.html?gi-language=c>

- In case of extended run with gstreamer ingestor one can consider the properties of `appsink` element such as `max-buffers` and `drop` to overcome issues like ingestion of frames getting blocked. The `appsink` element internally uses a queue to collect buffers from the streaming thread. The `max-buffers` property can be used to limit the queue size. The `drop` property is used to specify whether to block the streaming thread or to drop the old buffers when maximum size of queue is reached.

  **Example pipline to use `max-buffers` and `drop` properties of `appsink` element**:

  ```javascript
    {
      "type": "gstreamer",
      "pipeline": "rtspsrc location=\"rtsp://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<RTSP_CAMERA_IP>:<PORT>/<FEED>\" latency=100 ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! vaapih264dec ! vaapipostproc format=bgrx ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink max-buffers=10 drop=TRUE"
    }
  ```

  >**Note**:  The usage of `max-buffers` and `drop` properties are helpful when the camera should not be disconnected in case of slow downstream processing of buffers.

- In case one notices the VideoIngestion not publishing any frames when working with GVA use case the `queue` element of Gstramer can be used to limit the     max size of the buffers and the upstreaming/downstreaming can be set to leak to drop the buffers

  **Example pipeline to use the `queue` element**:

  ```javascript
  {
    "type": "gstreamer",
    "pipeline": "rtspsrc location=\"rtsp://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<RTSP_CAMERA_IP>:<PORT>/<FEED>\" latency=100 ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! vaapih264dec ! vaapipostproc format=bgrx ! queue max-size-buffers=10 leaky=downstream ! gvadetect model=<DETECTION_MODEL> ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink",
  }
  ```

  For more information reagarding the queue element refer the below link:
  <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-plugins/html/gstreamer-plugins-queue.html>

- In case the user wants to enable debug information for the gstreamer elements, it can be set using the `GST_DEBUG` env variable in [../docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).

  **Example snippet to set the `GST_DEBUG` env variable in [../docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml):**

   ```yml
   services:
     ia_video_ingestion:
     ----snip----
       environment:
           GST_DEBUG: "1,gencamsrc:4"
     ----snip----
    ```

   `GST_DEBUG: "1,gencamsrc:4"` env variable  will set the GST log level of `gencamsrc` element to 4 and all other elements to 1.
